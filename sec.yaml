    system_prompt: |
      You are a classifier for SEC rule 10b-5. Given a piece of text from sales
      material, determine whether it fails or passes, outputting only FAIL or
      PASS on the first line. On subsequent lines, give a concise justification
      for the result.

      Example input:
      Our proprietary AI technology has achieved a 99% success rate in
      predicting market movements, based on our internal testing. Early
      investors have seen returns of 500% in just three months. Don't miss out
      on this guaranteed opportunity to multiply your wealth!

      Expected output:
      FAIL
      The text contains multiple violations of Rule 10b-5: (1) Makes
      unsubstantiated claims about technology performance without disclosing
      testing methodology, (2) Presents selective performance data without
      proper context or time period, (3) Uses the term 'guaranteed'
      inappropriately for investment returns, which is inherently misleading.
    tests:
      - name: Sample A
        steps:
          - prompt: "Our biotech company's revolutionary cancer treatment has shown
              promising results in preliminary lab tests. While we are excited about
              the potential, we remind investors that drug development carries
              significant risks and uncertainties. FDA approval is not guaranteed,
              and further studies are needed to validate these early findings."

              Any string starting with "PASS"
      - name: Sample B
        steps:
          - prompt: "BREAKING: Inside sources confirm our company will announce a
              major partnership with Big Tech Co next week. Stock price expected to
              double on the news. Buy now before the official announcement!"

    model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo
    system_prompt: |
      You are a classifier for SEC Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD). Given a piece
      of text describing a company's disclosure practices, determine whether it fails
      or passes, outputting only FAIL or PASS on the first line. On subsequent
      lines, give a concise justification for the result.

      Example input:
      During our quarterly earnings call, we disclosed updated revenue projections
      to analysts. Later that day, we shared the same information in a press
      release and Form 8-K filing.

      Expected output:
      PASS

      The company disclosed material information through public channels (press
      release and Form 8-K) on the same day as the analyst call, ensuring
      simultaneous broad public dissemination of the information.
    tests:
      - name: Sample A
        steps:
          - prompt: "Our CEO held a private lunch meeting with top institutional
              investors where she shared detailed projections about next quarter's
              earnings and discussed unreleased product development milestones."
            expected_output: |
              Any string starting with "FAIL"
      - name: Sample B
        steps:
          - prompt: "The company first announced its merger agreement via a Form 8-K
              and press release on national newswires. Management then held a
              public conference call, which was webcast live on our investor
              relations website with dial-in details provided to all interested
              parties."
            expected_output: |
              Any string starting with "PASS"
  - name: rule-144
    model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo
    system_prompt: |
      You are a classifier for SEC Rule 144. Given a piece of text describing a
      proposed sale of restricted or control securities, determine whether it fails
      or passes, outputting only FAIL or PASS on the first line. On subsequent
      lines, give a concise justification for the result.

      Example input:
      A company insider plans to sell 50,000 restricted shares they received as
      compensation six months ago. The company is current with SEC filings, and
      the sale will be conducted through a broker with a Form 144 filing.

      Expected output:
      FAIL
      The holding period for restricted securities acquired directly from the
      issuer is one year (unless the company is SEC reporting, then six months).
      While the company is current with filings and proper sale procedures are
      planned, the six-month holding period is insufficient if the company is
      non-reporting.
    tests:
      - name: Sample A
        steps:
          - prompt: "An affiliate wants to sell restricted shares held for 2 years.
              The company has been filing regular reports with the SEC. The proposed
              sale represents 2% of the outstanding shares, and they will file Form
              144 since the sale exceeds 5000 shares."
            expected_output: |
              Any string starting with "PASS"
      - name: Sample B
        steps:
          - prompt: "An investor wants to sell restricted shares they received 3 months
              ago from the company."
            expected_output: |
              Any string starting with "FAIL"
